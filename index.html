           I’m watching you inlove and it seems to me I see my reflection in your soul but I know that beyond it’s an ocean too deep to ever embrace and I will have to spend my life crossing it. I love you and I will do it for ever, I will always cross you with a crazy longing to get as far away posible in your soul, I always keep my passion sails stretched so you storm me kisses in them, to break the waves of your clothes fabric over the body with my palms prow, to stuck them in your breasts and gaze at the horizon seagulls of your smiles calling naughtily “come, come, here is a magical realm only for you, come and discover it” .. .
          What beautiful world where you step with kisses, where you breathe love and eyes are arms that grow heavy with treasures until they breaks into tears; what a world, what beautiful sea are you, what magic you give to my sands…</p>
