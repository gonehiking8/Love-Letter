           I’m watching you inlove and it seems to me I see my reflection in your soul but I know that beyond it’s an ocean too deep to ever embrace and I will have to spend my life crossing it. I love you and I will do it for ever, I will always cross you with a crazy longing to get as far away posible in your soul, I always keep my passion sails stretched so you storm me kisses in them, to break the waves of your clothes fabric over the body with my palms prow, to stuck them in your breasts and gaze at the horizon seagulls of your smiles calling naughtily “come, come, here is a magical realm only for you, come and discover it” .. .
          What beautiful world where you step with kisses, where you breathe love and eyes are arms that grow heavy with treasures until they breaks into tears; what a world, what beautiful sea are you, what magic you give to my sands…</p>

      <div id="letter2">
        <h1>Dear <span class="firstname"></span>,</h1>
        <p>
          Love, angel with wings torn by insane people, how can you beg on earth when in sky palaces are raised for you, people laugh by your red crying eyes and hugs are rewarded with palms. You, the mother of the humans, and father, sister, brother, sister, friend, lover or anything else you need to be, you, the salvage from the darkest sufferings, you who born everything is beautiful in the world. From so many hearts you listen your humble death conviction, from so many lips you get the lie venom.
          You call hearts to you with gentle charm, they crucify you in piercings and they spit you with venereal diseases, in beauty you lure them, they rip it from you greedy and they wallow in the mud with her. You tell uplifting stories, you do miracles, but who to hear them and see them in a foggy and squeaky world as it never was. Love, angel with torn wings, I will trust you always the most because you are the bravest from all and the only one who will never give up.
